# ArduILDA
Ddocuments and code to use a laser with ILDA input with an Arduino and controlling it with Processing.

Right now, only rudimentary examples and workshop documentation are provided, the following steps are:

* Arduino library that wraps shapes such as circles, lines and polygons.
* Processing library that wraps ways of sending little data through the serial to Arduino in order to control the forementioned shapes.

Remember, whenever you're working with lasers, don't stand between the laser field and the screen. An exposure to the laser beams might cause permanent eye damage. Same applies to the audience, don't point to them. Follow safety guidelines and local regulations.
